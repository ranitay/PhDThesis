\chapter*{Dedication and Acknowledgements}
\begin{SingleSpace}
\initial{I} wish to express my deepest gratitudes to both of my advisors, Dr. Ranny Budnik and Prof. Ehud Duchovni for their mentorship and guidance along my scientific path. I would also like to thank Dr. Hagar Landsman for all the fruitful discussions, great advises and assistance with any problem in the past years.

I thank my friends Nadav, Jony, and Micahel for a decade of fun and support, and more importantly for convincing me to come and stay in Weizmann Institute. I also want to thank the department of particle physics and astrophysics members with whom I have had a great time working with.
  
I thank my family for supporting and pushing me to study the science of physics and to go after my desires. Moreover I thank them for raising me to ask questions and to investigate everything, which have aroused my thirst for knowledge. Last but not least I would like to dedicate this work to my late brother Meron, I know you were and will always be with me along the way.
