First column gives recoil energies, subsequent columns give the values of $G'_i(E)$ for each of the 9 high-energy analysis bins. The sampling is in steps of $10~\mathrm {keV_\mathrm {nr}}$, which is too coarse to give an accurate signal model for very low WIMP masses, but is suitable for the mass range most relevant to our analysis. Higher resolution $G'_i(E)$ functions, and $G'_i(E)$ functions for other values of $\mathcal {L}_{\mathrm {eff}}$, are given in supplementary material. }}{20}{table.A.1}
